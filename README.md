# Text-Manipulator

Program written by Hunter Bossetto

This program was an assignment created for class.

In this program, the user will be asked if they want to make the case of their text all upper or lower case, or they can have to program display the total word count or the total number of vowels in the text. The text that will be maniupulated by the program is entered by the user after they make their selection from the menu. The program will continue until the user enters 5 to exit.
